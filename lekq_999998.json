{"abstract": [{"abstract_id": 131512, "title": "Introductions and evolutions of SARS-CoV-2 strains in Japan", "abstract": "COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Japan on January 15th, 2020, soon after the pandemic originated in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, Japan experienced three distinct waves of the outbreak in the span of a year and has been attributed to new exogenous strains and evolving existing strains. Japan engaged very early on in tracking different COVID-19 sub-strains and have sequenced approximately 5% of all confirmed cases. While Japan has enforced stringent airport surveillance on cross-border travelers and returnees, some carriers appear to have advanced through the quarantine stations undetected. In this study, 17112 genomes sampled in Japan were analyzed to understand the strains, heterogeneity and temporal evolution of different SARS-CoV-2 strains. We identified 11 discrete strains with a substantial number of cases with most strains possessing the spike (S) D614G and nucleocapsid (N) 203\\_204delinsKR mutations. Besides these variants, ORF1ab P3371S, A4815V, S1361P, and N P151L were also detected in nearly half the samples constituting the most common strain in Japan. 115 distinct strains have been introduced into Japan and 12 of them were introduced after strict quarantine policy was implemented. In particular, the B.1.1.7 strain, that emerged in the United Kingdom (UK) in September 2020, has been circulating in Japan since late 2020 after eluding cross-border quarantine stations. Similarly, the B.1.351 strain dubbed the South African variant, P.1 Brazilian strain and R.1 strain with the spike E484K mutation have been detected in Japan. At least four exogenous B.1.1.7 sub-strains have been independently introduced in Japan as of late January 2021, and these strains carry mutations that give selective advantage including N501Y, H69\\_V70del, and E484K that confer increased transmissibility, reduced efficacy to vaccines and possible increased virulence. It is imperative that the quarantine policy be revised, cross-border surveillance reinforced, and new public health measures implemented to mitigate further transmission of this deadly disease and to identify strains that may engender resistance to vaccines.\n\n<br><br><span style = 'color: blue'>Key Sentences:</span><br><span style = 'color: green'>At least four exogenous B.1.1.7 sub-strains have been independently introduced in Japan as of late January 2021, and these strains carry mutations that give selective advantage including N501Y, H69\\_V70del, and E484K that confer increased transmissibility, reduced efficacy to vaccines and possible increased virulence.</span><br><br><span style = 'color: green'>Subsequently, Japan experienced three distinct waves of the outbreak in the span of a year and has been attributed to new exogenous strains and evolving existing strains.</span><br><br><span style = 'color: green'>It is imperative that the quarantine policy be revised, cross-border surveillance reinforced, and new public health measures implemented to mitigate further transmission of this deadly disease and to identify strains that may engender resistance to vaccines.</span><br><br><span style = 'color: green'>Similarly, the B.1.351 strain dubbed the South African variant, P.1 Brazilian strain and R.1 strain with the spike E484K mutation have been detected in Japan.</span><br><br><span style = 'color: green'>Japan engaged very early on in tracking different COVID-19 sub-strains and have sequenced approximately 5% of all confirmed cases.</span><br><br><span style = 'color: green'>We identified 11 discrete strains with a substantial number of cases with most strains possessing the spike (S) D614G and nucleocapsid (N) 203\\_204delinsKR mutations.</span><br><br><span style = 'color: green'>In particular, the B.1.1.7 strain, that emerged in the United Kingdom (UK) in September 2020, has been circulating in Japan since late 2020 after eluding cross-border quarantine stations.</span><br><br><span style = 'color: green'>While Japan has enforced stringent airport surveillance on cross-border travelers and returnees, some carriers appear to have advanced through the quarantine stations undetected.</span><br><br>", "doi": "10.1101/2021.02.26.21252555", "publish_time": "2021-03-02T00:00:00.000Z", "authors": "Tokumasu, Reitaro;Weeraratne, Dilhan;Snowdon, Jane;Parida, Laxmi;Kudo, Michiharu;Koyama, Takahiko", "journal": "", "source_x": "medRxiv", "pubmed_id": "", "score": 13.047816, "p_type": "Preprint", "condition": "COVID-19", "cd": "Monostearyl", "target": "", "device": ""}, {"abstract_id": 92504, "title": "COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.", "abstract": "The disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), is a global emergency.

The Japanese government focused on mitigating the emerging COVID-19 clusters by conducting active nationwide epidemiological surveillance. However, an increasing number of cases continued to appear until early April 2020, many with unclear infection routes and no recent history of travel outside Japan. We aimed to evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome sequences from the COVID-19 cases that appeared until early April 2020 and to characterize their genealogical networks in order to demonstrate possible routes of spread in Japan. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from patients, and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed. Positive RNA samples were subjected to whole-genome sequencing, and a haplotype network analysis was performed. Some of the primary clusters identified during January and February 2020 in Japan descended directly from the Wuhan-Hu-1-related isolates from China and other distinct clusters.

Machine learning was conducted to estimate the positive rate in Japan and four prefectures (Tokyo, Osaka, Chiba, and Fukuoka).\n\nResults Primary data analysis revealed there were at least two peaks of infection in Japan; the first one was during April 2020 and the second one started from November 1, 2020. Estimating the positive rate in Japan as well as in the four prefectures reinforced the above observations. The positive rate in Japan during 2020 was estimated to be around 6% to 8%.

The PCR tests are widely used to detect infections. However, multiple regression analysis revealed no correlation between the examination rate among population (ER) and the success of containment, which is achieved by social distancing. ER and fatality rate were even positively correlated. Japan has been criticized for its very low ER, but it achieved better containment than other major countries with much higher ER on 29 May. The estimation of the true infection rate (TIR) among population revealed that the low fatality rate in Japan and other Asian countries is partly due to low TIR. Fatality of COVID-19 is highly accentuated in aged persons. Despite having the highest aging rate in the world, the fatality rate in Japan is relatively low. The corrected fatality rate of Japan is the second-lowest among the G20 countries.

However, confirmed numbers would not capture entire disease burden of COVID-19. Our objective was to estimate overall excess mortality in Japan during COVID-19 pandemic, or March and April 2020, using data from local government. Method: Vital statistic data of 13 populous cities in Japan, (Total population: 22\u00b74 Millions) and one comparator city where no Covid-19 case was reported were used. Monthly mortality rate per 100,000 resident was set to benchmark value. Time-series analyses, using State Spacing Model were used to forecast the trend of mortality, in order to incorporate underlying factors like aging. Excess death was calculated only if actual mortality data exceeded the upper 95% confidence limit of projected values. Findings: In April 2020, the highest mortality rate for each April for the whole observation period were observed in almost all cities , while they were lower than those of January 2020. The number of excess deaths were varied depending of models, zero to 1,016 in March 2020 and 401 to 1,535 in April 2020. Less than 10% were attributable to confirmed COVID-19 deaths and occurrence pattern were irrelevant to COVID-19 dissemination status. Interpretation: There might be slight excess mortality in April 2020 throughout Japan and other factors than COVID-19 itself, like access limitation to healthcare facilities could contribute to it, which warrant further researches.

The purpose of this research was to assess the risk of COVID-19 epidemic dissemination in Japan by estimating the current state of epidemic dissemination and providing some epidemic prevention and control recommendations. Firstly, the period from 6 January to 31 March 2020 was divided into four stages and the relevant parameters were estimated according to the imported cases in Japan. The basic reproduction number of the current stage is 1.954 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.851-2.025), which means COVID-19 will spread quickly, and the self-healing rate of Japanese is about 0.495 (95% CI 0.437-0.506), with small variations in the four stages. Secondly, the results were applied to the actual reported cases from 1 to 5 April 2020, verifying the reliability of the estimated data using the accumulated reported cases located within the 95% confidence interval and the relative error of forecast data of five days being less than 2 . 5 % . Thirdly, considering the medical resources in Japan, the times the epidemic beds and ventilators become fully occupied are predicted as 5 and 15 May 2020, respectively. Keeping with the current situation, the final death toll in Japan may reach into the millions. Finally, based on experience with COVID-19 prevention and control in China, robust measures such as nationwide shutdown, store closures, citizens isolating themselves at home, and increasing PCR testing would quickly and effectively prevent COVID-19 spread.<br><br><span style = 'color: blue'>Key Sentences:</span><br><span style = 'color: green'>Finally, based on experience with COVID-19 prevention and control in China, robust measures such as nationwide shutdown, store closures, citizens isolating themselves at home, and increasing PCR testing would quickly and effectively prevent COVID-19 spread.</span><br><br><span style = 'color: green'>The purpose of this research was to assess the risk of COVID-19 epidemic dissemination in Japan by estimating the current state of epidemic dissemination and providing some epidemic prevention and control recommendations.</span><br><br><span style = 'color: green'>Secondly, the results were applied to the actual reported cases from 1 to 5 April 2020, verifying the reliability of the estimated data using the accumulated reported cases located within the 95% confidence interval and the relative error of forecast data of five days being less than 2 .</span><br><br><span style = 'color: green'>COVID-19 has globally spread to over 4 million people and the epidemic situation in Japan is very serious.</span><br><br><span style = 'color: green'>The basic reproduction number of the current stage is 1.954 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.851-2.025), which means COVID-19 will spread quickly, and the self-healing rate of Japanese is about 0.495 (95% CI 0.437-0.506), with small variations in the four stages.</span><br><br><span style = 'color: green'>Keeping with the current situation, the final death toll in Japan may reach into the millions.</span><br><br><span style = 'color: green'>Firstly, the period from 6 January to 31 March 2020 was divided into four stages and the relevant parameters were estimated according to the imported cases in Japan.</span><br><br><span style = 'color: green'>Thirdly, considering the medical resources in Japan, the times the epidemic beds and ventilators become fully occupied are predicted as 5 and 15 May 2020, respectively.</span><br><br>", "doi": "10.3390/ijerph17113872", "publish_time": "2020-06-04T00:00:00.000Z", "authors": "Chen, Zhongxiang;Yang, Jun;Dai, Binxiang", "journal": "International journal of environmental research and public health", "source_x": "Peer reviewed (PubMed)", "pubmed_id": "32486011", "score": 12.0768795, "p_type": "Journal Article", "condition": "COVID-19;Death", "cd": "", "target": "", "device": "Ventilator Equipment"}, {"abstract_id": 108454, "title": "A Logistic Formula in Biology and Its Application to Deaths by the Third Wave of COVID-19 in Japan", "abstract": "A logistic formulation in biology is applied to analyze deaths by the third wave of COVID-19 in Japan.\n\n<br><br><span style = 'color: blue'>Key Sentences:</span><br><span style = 'color: green'>A logistic formulation in biology is applied to analyze deaths by the third wave of COVID-19 in Japan.</span><br><br><span style = 'color: green'></span><br><br>", "doi": "10.1101/2021.01.30.21250827", "publish_time": "2021-02-02T00:00:00.000Z", "authors": "Kokado, Akira;Saito, Takesi", "journal": "", "source_x": "medRxiv", "pubmed_id": "", "score": 12.069944, "p_type": "Preprint", "condition": "COVID-19;Death", "cd": "", "target": "", "device": ""}, {"abstract_id": 128035, "title": "Negative Excess Mortality in Pneumonia Death caused by COVID-19 in Japan", "abstract": "Background: Since the emergence of COVID-19, cases of excess mortality from all causes have been very few in Japan.
